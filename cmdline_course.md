## In general
The course was about using command-line environment for useful linguistic tasks.

## Week 1
The commands included in this week are `ls` for listing the content of the current directory, 
`cd` for changing directory, `wget` for getting the content from the internet, `less` for displaying
a text file, `cp` for copying files and `mv` to move or rename files.<br>
I learned to fluently use the command line for basic tasks.
