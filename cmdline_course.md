## In general
The course was about using command-line environment for useful linguistic tasks. The course is given at the University 
of Helsinki.
| Week | Commands I've learned |
| 1 | `ls`, `cd`, `wget`, `less`, `cp`, `mv` |
| 2 | `rm -r`, `chmod`, `kill` |
| 3 | |
| 4 | |

## Week 1
The commands included in this week are `ls` for listing the content of the current directory, 
`cd` for changing directory, `wget` for getting the content from the internet, `less` for displaying
a text file, `cp` for copying files and `mv` to move or rename files.<br>
I learned to fluently use the command line for basic tasks.

## Week 2
The week contained three parts:
- the first part was about copying, moving and removing the directories. It was also mentioned
what standard system directories are present in UNIX systems.
- the second part was about processes and process management using the command line
- the third part was about working on a remote server using ssh
For example command
```
chmod a+r filename
```
adds read permissions for the file filename without changing write and execute permissions.<br>
Command
```
kill pid
```
kills the process with the given PID.<br>
I learned how to find the PID of a process and kill the process, change permissions and work on directories. I can run commands in the background and move a process to the background.
